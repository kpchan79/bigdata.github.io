    <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p> <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank"> Big data</i></a>
            primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. <br>
            <strong>Data</strong> with many fields (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate. 
            Though used sometimes loosely partly because of a lack of formal definition, the interpretation that seems to best describe Big data is the one associated with large body of information that we could not comprehend when used only in smaller amounts.</p>
        <p>Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. 
            Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.
            The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. 
            Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. 
            Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.</p>

    <p>Big data can be described by the following characteristics:</p>
    <h4>Volumn</h4>
    <p>The quantity of generated and stored data. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight, and whether it can be considered big data or not. The size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes.</p>
    <h4>Variety</h4>
    <p>The type and nature of the data. The earlier technologies like RDBMSs were capable to handle structured data efficiently and effectively. However, the change in type and nature from structured to semi-structured or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies. The big data technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture, store, and process the semi-structured and unstructured (variety) data generated with high speed (velocity), and huge in size (volume). Later, these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for storage. Eventually, the processing of structured data was still kept as optional, either using big data or traditional RDBMSs. This helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights exposed from the data collected via social media, log files, sensors, etc. Big data draws from text, images, audio, video; plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion.</p>
    <h4>Velocity</h4>
    <p>The speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development. Big data is often available in real-time. Compared to small data, big data is produced more continually. Two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling, recording, and publishing.</p>
